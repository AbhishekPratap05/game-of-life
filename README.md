# game of life
### This react app created to demonstrate [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), This game has sets of rule which has to be followed.
### Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
